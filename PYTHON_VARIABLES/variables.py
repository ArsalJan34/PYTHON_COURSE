# variables is a concept in programming to store data values. 
# In python, variables are created when you assign a value to them.
name = 'Arsal'
print(name)
# so here we created a variable called name and assigned it the value 'Arsal'
# check the length of the variable name we use the len() function
print(len(input("What is your name?")))
# here we used three steps one is the input function to get the name from the user, second is the len function to check the length of the name 
# and third is the print function to print the length of the name 
# now we are going to split these three steps into three different lines of code
name = input("What is your name?")
Length = len(name)
print(Length)
